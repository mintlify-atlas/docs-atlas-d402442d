# Welcome to Platforma

Platforma is a modern Go web framework that embraces domain-driven architecture to help you build robust, production-ready web applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for HTTP servers, database management, background jobs, scheduled tasks, and structured logging.

## Why Platforma?

Platforma is designed around **domain-driven design principles**, giving you a clear structure for organizing your application logic into bounded contexts. Each domain encapsulates its repository, service layer, HTTP handlers, and middleware—making your codebase maintainable and testable.

### Built for Production

  <Card title="Graceful Shutdown" icon="power-off">
    All services handle shutdown signals properly, draining connections before exit

  <Card title="Structured Logging" icon="list">
    Context-aware logging with trace IDs for request tracking
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Features

### Application Lifecycle Management

The `Application` type orchestrates your entire application lifecycle—from startup tasks to graceful shutdown. Register services, databases, and domains, and let Platforma handle the rest.

```go
app := application.New()
app.RegisterService("api", httpServer)
app.RegisterDatabase("main", database)
app.RegisterDomain("auth", "main", authDomain)
app.Run(ctx)
```

### HTTP Server with Middleware

Build RESTful APIs with an intuitive routing system that supports middleware at both server and route group levels. Includes built-in middleware for trace IDs, authentication, panic recovery, and more.

```go
server := httpserver.New("8080", 3*time.Second)
server.Use(log.NewTraceIDMiddleware(nil, ""))
server.HandleFunc("/health", healthHandler)
```

### Database Integration

PostgreSQL integration with `sqlx` for powerful SQL operations and an embedded migration system. Migrations are versioned SQL files tracked automatically.

<Note>
Platforma uses the `lib/pq` PostgreSQL driver, not `pgx`.
</Note>

### Background Job Processing

Generic queue processor with worker pools for handling background jobs. Supports graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts to drain remaining jobs.

```go
processor := queue.New(handler, queueProvider, workersAmount, shutdownTimeout)
app.RegisterService("queue", processor)
```

### Scheduled Tasks

Cron-based task scheduler for periodic execution. Supports standard cron expressions and interval syntax like `@every 5m`.

```go
scheduler, _ := scheduler.New("0 2 * * *", cleanupTask)
app.RegisterService("scheduler", scheduler)
```

### Domain-Driven Architecture

Organize your application into domains—bounded contexts that encapsulate all related functionality:

- **Repository**: Database operations and migrations
- **Service**: Business logic and domain rules
- **Handlers**: HTTP endpoint controllers
- **Middleware**: Request processing and authentication

See the [auth domain](/api/auth) as a complete reference implementation.

## Framework Philosophy

<Warning>
Platforma enforces strict conventions for code quality:
- No `testify` assertions—use standard library
- No external mocking libraries—hand-roll mocks per test
- No global state (except `log.Logger`)
- No `init` functions—enforced by `gochecknoinits` linter
</Warning>

These constraints encourage explicit dependencies, testable code, and predictable behavior.
